# 🌟Image Vision🌟: A Deep Learning Model for Object Detection and Classification 🚀


By : [@anuj_dwivedi](https://linktr.ee/anuj_dwivedi)

## Project Overview 📝

🔍 Image Vision is a deep learning model for object detection and classification using computer vision techniques. The model uses state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO, to detect and classify objects in images with high accuracy. The model can be trained on custom datasets to improve its performance for specific use cases. 

🛠️ The project is implemented using Python programming language and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The model is trained on GPU for faster training times and improved accuracy. 

💻 The project also includes a user-friendly GUI application built with PyQT5, allowing users to easily upload images and view the model's predictions. 

## Features and Benefits ✨

- Accurate object detection and classification for a wide range of use cases.
